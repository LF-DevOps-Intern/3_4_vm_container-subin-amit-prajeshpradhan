# Question 4

> What are the problems Container solves in regard to app deployment and how it solves?

Containers can solve some drawbacks from Virtualization but use case of each architecture depends on the requirement of the application. 

In regards to app deployment containers can solve problems like:
- **Increased portability**
Containerization helps to package applications and their dependencies into portable application images that are easy to distribute to artifact repositories and then onto container hosts that will run them.
- **Running applications in isolation**
Container engine and command line tool make it simple to retrieve application images and start isolated instances of each application process.
- **Greater efficiency**
Containers makes it easy to follow agile development methodology and allows applications to be more rapidly deployed, patched, or scaled.
